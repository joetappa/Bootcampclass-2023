Configuration of NFS Server
===========================

Step 1: 

Create one Server for NFS

Install NFS Kernel Server in 
Before installing the NFS Kernel server, we need to update our systemâ€™s 
repository index with that of the Internet through the following apt command as sudo:
$sudo apt-get update
     the above command lets you install the latest available version of a software
     through the ubuntu repositories.
     Now, run the following command in order to install the NFS kernel server on 
     your system : 
     $sudo apt install nfs-kernel-server -y 
Step 2: Create the Export Directory [mount point]
      sudo mkdir -p /mnt/share/
      ## As we want all clients to access the directory, we will remove restrictive 
      permissions.
      sudo mkdir -p /mnt/share/
      sudo chown nobody:nogroup /mnt/share/
      sudo chmod 777 /mnt/share/
 step 3: Assgn server access to client(s) 
         through NFS export file

         sudo vi /etc/exports  

         # /mnt/share/  <clientIP or Clients
          CIDR>(rw,sync,no_subtree_check,no_root_squash)
          #Ex:
          /mnt/share/ *(rw,sync,no_subtree_check,no_root_squash)

 Step 4: Export the shared directory
          $ sudo exportfs -a
          $ sudo systemctl restart nfs-kernel-server

 Step 5: Open firewall for the client (s) Port 2049.


Configuring the cient Machine
================================
Step 6: Install NFS common 
        Before installing the NFS common application 
        we need to update our system's repository
        index with that of the internet through the 
        following apt command as sudo:

        $sudo apt-get update -y && sudo apt-get install nfs-common -y 
        Install NFS agents on all worker nodes (Node1 and Node 11) 
        using the above command
        $sudo apt-get install nfs-common
