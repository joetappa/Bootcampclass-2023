1. What is Git, and how does it differ from other version control systems?
Answer: Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project.
It differs from other systems by its distributed nature, speed, and ability to handle branching and merging efficiently.

 2. Explain the basic Git workflow.
Answer: The basic Git workflow involves three main stages: working directory, staging area, and repository. 
Changes are made in the working directory, staged using git add to move them to the staging area, 
and then committed to the repository using git commit.

3. What is a repository in Git?
Answer: A repository in Git is a storage location for a project, containing the project's files, 
version history, and configuration data. It can be local (on a developer's machine) or remote (on a server, e.g., GitHub).

 4. What is the purpose of the staging area in Git?
Answer: The staging area allows developers to selectively choose which changes to include in the next commit. 
It acts as a middle ground where modifications are prepared before being committed.

 5. Describe the difference between Git pull and Git fetch.
Answer: git pull fetches changes from a remote repository and merges them into the current branch. 
git fetch only retrieves changes from the remote but doesn't automatically merge them. 
It allows you to review changes before merging.

 6. Explain the concept of branching in Git.
Answer: Branching in Git allows developers to create separate lines of development. Each branch represents a 
different set of changes, and they can be merged back together later.

 7. What is a merge conflict in Git, and how can it be resolved?
Answer: A merge conflict occurs when Git cannot automatically merge changes from different branches.
It requires manual intervention to resolve conflicts by editing the conflicting files, marking them as resolved, 
and then committing the changes.

 8.  How does Git handle binary files?
Answer: Git tracks changes to binary files by storing each version separately. This can lead to larger 
repository sizes for binary files, and it may not handle them as efficiently as text files.

 9.  What is the purpose of the .gitignore file?
Answer: The .gitignore file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.
It's used to prevent irrelevant files (like build artifacts, logs, and temporary files) from being accidentally committed.

 11.   Explain the difference between Git and GitHub.
Answer: Git is a version control system, while GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting for Git repositories.
GitHub enhances collaboration by providing features like pull requests, issue tracking, and project management tools.

 12.   What is a pull request in GitHub, and how does it facilitate collaboration?
Answer: A pull request is a GitHub feature that allows developers to propose changes to a repository. 
It facilitates collaboration by providing a space for discussion, reviewing code changes,
and integrating the proposed modifications into the main branch.

 13.   How do you revert a commit that has already been pushed and shared with others?
Answer: Use git revert to create a new commit that undoes the changes introduced by a previous commit. 
This allows you to maintain a clean history without rewriting the commit history.

 14.   What is Git cherry-pick, and when would you use it?
Answer: Git cherry-pick is used to apply a specific commit from one branch to another.
It is useful when you want to pick specific changes from one branch and apply them to another.

 15.   Explain the Git rebase command and when it might be used.
Answer: Git rebase is used to move or combine a sequence of commits to a new base commit.
It is often used to maintain a clean and linear commit history by incorporating changes from one branch into another.

16.   How do you undo the last Git commit?
Answer: Use git reset HEAD~1 to undo the last commit while keeping the changes in the working directory. 
If the changes should be discarded, use git reset --hard HEAD~1.

 17.   What is the Git bisect command used for?
Answer: Git bisect is used for binary search through the commit history to find when a bug was introduced. 
It helps identify the commit that introduced a problem by narrowing down the range of potentially problematic commits.

18.   Describe the concept of Git hooks.
Answer: Git hooks are scripts that can be executed at key points in the Git workflow, 
such as pre-commit or post-merge. They allow developers to automate tasks or enforce custom workflows.

19.   How do you squash multiple commits into a single commit in Git?
Answer: Use git rebase -i HEAD~n (where n is the number of commits to squash). In the interactive rebase, 
mark commits as "squash" to combine them into a single commit.

 20.   Explain the purpose of Git submodules.
Answer: Git submodules allow you to include other Git repositories within your own repository. 
They are useful for managing dependencies or including external projects as part of your larger project.

 21.   How would you handle a situation where you accidentally push sensitive information (like passwords) to a Git repository?
Answer: Immediately remove the sensitive information from the code.
Then use git filter-branch or git filter-repo to remove the sensitive data from the entire commit history. 
Finally, force-push the corrected history to the remote repository, and communicate the issue to other collaborators.
