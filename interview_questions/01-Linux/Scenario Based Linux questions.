Here are few scenario based Interview questions on Linux for DevOps which can help you crack the job:- 

1. *Q: You notice a sudden spike in server CPU utilization. How would you troubleshoot and identify the root cause?*
   - A: I would check CPU usage using top or htop, identify the culprit process with ps or pidstat, analyze logs for events, 
        and optimize or scale resources accordingly.

2. *Q: A critical application on your Linux server is unresponsive. Walk me through the steps
       you would take to diagnose and resolve the issue.*

   - A: I'd use ps and top to identify the hung process, check logs for errors, 
        restart the application or services, and monitor for improvements.

3. *Q: You need to deploy a new version of a web application on a Linux server without causing downtime. 
       Explain the steps you would take to achieve a zero-downtime deployment.*

   - A: Implement a load balancer, deploy the new version on one server at a time, 
        validate each step, and update the load balancer to include new servers.

4. *Q: A team member accidentally deleted important files on a Linux server. How would you recover the lost data?*

   - A: I'd use file recovery tools like extundelete or photorec, avoid writing new data to prevent overwriting, 
         and restore from backups if available.

5. *Q: Your Linux server is running out of disk space. What steps would you take to identify and resolve the issue,
       considering both short-term and long-term solutions?*

   - A: Identify large files with du and df, remove unnecessary files, implement log rotation, 
        and consider long-term solutions like additional storage.

6. *Q: Explain how you would set up and configure a basic firewall on a Linux server to enhance its security.*
   - A: Use iptables or firewalld to set up rules, allow only necessary ports and services, 
        and regularly review and update firewall rules.

7. *Q: Your team is working on a collaborative project, and you want to implement version control using Git on a Linux server.
       How would you set up and manage the Git repository?*

   - A: Initialize a Git repository with git init, add and commit files, push to a central repository, 
        and collaborate using branches and pull requests.

8. *Q: You want to monitor the performance of your Linux server over time.
       What tools and techniques would you use for performance monitoring and analysis?*

   - A: Use tools like sar, vmstat, and iostat for monitoring, set up alerts for abnormal behavior,
        and consider long-term solutions like Prometheus.

9. *Q: You are responsible for securing a Linux server. Outline the security measures and 
       best practices you would implement to protect against potential threats.*

   - A: Keep the system and software updated, configure a firewall, implement strong user authentication,
        regularly audit and review system logs, and apply the principle of least privilege.
