# Helm Basics:

What is Helm, and why is it used in Kubernetes environments?

Answer: Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that simplifies the deployment and management of applications. It allows the packaging, versioning, 
and deployment of Kubernetes manifests as charts.

Explain the components of a Helm chart.

Answer: A Helm chart consists of two main components: the Chart.yaml file (containing metadata) and a set of Kubernetes manifests organized 
in directories (templates). Optionally, it may include values files, helpers, and pre/post-install and upgrade hooks.

How does Helm handle dependencies between different components of an application?

Answer: Helm uses subcharts and dependencies specified in the Chart.yaml file to manage the relationships between different components of an application.
Subcharts are essentially Helm charts that are included within a parent chart.

# Helm Commands:

What is the command to install a Helm chart?

Answer: The command to install a Helm chart is helm install [RELEASE_NAME] [CHART].

Explain the purpose of the values.yaml file in a Helm chart.

Answer: The values.yaml file allows users to customize the default configuration of a Helm chart. It provides a way to override 
default values defined in the chart's templates.

How do you upgrade a Helm release with a new chart version or modified values?

Answer: To upgrade a Helm release, you use the helm upgrade command. For example, helm upgrade [RELEASE_NAME] [CHART].

What is the purpose of the helm lint command, and when would you use it?

Answer: The helm lint command checks a Helm chart for issues and ensures that it follows best practices. 
It's used during chart development to catch potential problems before deployment.

How do you rollback a Helm release to a previous version?

Answer: The helm rollback command is used to revert a release to a previous version. For example, helm rollback [RELEASE_NAME] [REVISION_NUMBER].

# Helm Repositories:

Explain the difference between a local Helm chart repository and a remote Helm chart repository.

Answer: A local Helm chart repository is a directory on your local machine or a shared filesystem, 
while a remote Helm chart repository is a server hosting charts that can be accessed by users. 
Helm charts can be stored, shared, and retrieved from both types of repositories.

How do you add a Helm chart repository to your local Helm client?

Answer: The helm repo add command is used to add a Helm chart repository. For example, helm repo add [REPO_NAME] [REPO_URL].

Explain the purpose of the helm search command.

Answer: The helm search command allows users to search for Helm charts in the configured repositories. It provides information about available charts,
their versions, and maintainers.

# Helm Templating:

What is templating in Helm, and how does it help in managing Kubernetes manifests?

Answer: Templating in Helm allows the dynamic generation of Kubernetes manifests based on user-defined values. It helps manage configuration changes and 
supports code reuse through templating language constructs.

How do you use conditional logic in Helm templates?

Answer: Helm uses the Go templating language, allowing the use of conditional statements like if, else, and range within templates. 
Conditional logic helps generate Kubernetes manifests based on specific conditions.

# Helm Charts Best Practices:

What are some best practices for creating Helm charts?

Answer: Best practices include organizing charts into logical directories, using values files for customization, providing clear documentation, and 
following the Helm chart structure conventions. It's also recommended to use versioning for charts.

How can Helm charts be made more reusable and shareable across different projects?

Answer: Helm charts can be made more reusable by parameterizing values, avoiding hard-coded references to namespaces, and minimizing dependencies.
Properly documenting charts and ensuring they are versioned enhances shareability.

# Security and Helm:

Explain the security considerations when using Helm.

Answer: Helm itself does not provide strong security mechanisms. It's essential to manage access to Helm installations and repositories,
avoid using insecure chart sources, and review charts for potential security risks. 
The use of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and secure channels for communication is recommended.

How can you use Helm to manage secrets securely?

Answer: Helm provides the secrets template function for handling sensitive information securely. 
Secrets can be stored in encrypted form within the chart and decrypted during installation.
