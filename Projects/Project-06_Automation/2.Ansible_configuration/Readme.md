# ANSIBLE CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT â€“ AUTOMATATION

You have been implementing some interesting projects up untill now, and that is awesome.

In Projects 4 and 5 you had to perform a lot of manual operations to set up virtual servers, install and configure required software to deploy your web application.

This Project will make you appreciate DevOps tools even more by making most of the routine tasks automated with Ansible Configuration Management, at the same time you will become confident at writing code using declarative language such as YAML.

Let us get started!
