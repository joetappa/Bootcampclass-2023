Note: when you have already learned how to deploy LAMP, LEMP and MERN Web stacks – it is time to get yourself familiar with MEAN stack and deploy it to Ubuntu server.

MEAN Stack is a combination of following components:

- MongoDB (Document database) – Stores and allows to retrieve data.
- Express (Back-end application framework) – Makes requests to Database for Reads and Writes.
- Angular (Front-end application framework) – Handles Client and Server Requests
- Node.js (JavaScript runtime environment) – Accepts requests and displays results to end user
